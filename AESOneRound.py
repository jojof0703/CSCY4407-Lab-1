"""
This program implements one round of the AES encryption algorithm. 
It performs the following steps on a 4x4 matrix:
1. Subbytes: subsitutue each byte using an S-box
2. Shift rows: rotate each row by a set offset
3. MixColumns: Mix the columns using arithmetic in galiois field
4. AddRoundKey: XOR the state matrix with the provided round key. 
The program will print the state of the matrix after each step.
